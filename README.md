I am a Junior Programmer and 3D Artist with good aptitudes, hard worker and sociable, looking forward to earn more experience. IT is my passion and everything that has to do with programming, including video game development , thats why I specialized in both Programming and 3D Art. It is something I enjoy and I can give my best every day, where I am always open to learn new skills.
